# Tic-tac-toe-using-adversarial-search

Implemented a simple Connect 4 game to demonstrate the use of adversarial search for determinis-
tic, fully observable, two player turn-taking zero-sum games. This is based on the minmax with alpha-beta pruning agent that allows you to play against the computer.

#How to play?
* Clone the repository
* Navigate to src folder
* Run adversarial_search.py using "$python3 adversarial_search.py"
* Enter the height of the board
* Enter the width of the board
* Enter the depth of search (more than 5 takes more time to process)
* Enter the column to place the coin (AI takes the first turn)
